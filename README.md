# LinkedCamp for Hermes

Run [LinkedCamp][lc] LinkedIn and email outreach from
[Hermes Agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com). Ask Hermes to build a
campaign for an audience, write the sequence, check how campaigns are doing, or
triage the replies that came in. It works with your existing [LinkedCamp][lc]
account and its permissions.

```
You:    Set up a campaign for Heads of RevOps at Series B SaaS in the UK.
        Connect request, message on accept, email if they go quiet.
        Show me the draft first.

Hermes: Pro plan, so email steps are available.
        Sending from "Sarah Chen" (34/100 weekly invites used), mailbox sarah@acme.io.
        I need a Sales Navigator search URL with the UK and company-size filters set.
```

This is an [Agent Plugins v1](https://agent-plugins.org/specification) package
with no executable code of its own:

| File | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `plugin.json` | Package manifest. Marks the [LinkedCamp][lc] server `untrusted`, so Hermes asks before any tool that writes |
| `mcp.json` | Connects to the hosted [LinkedCamp][lc] MCP server at `https://mcp.linkedcamp.com/mcp` |
| `skills/linkedcamp-outreach/SKILL.md` | How to build campaigns safely, what needs confirmation, and what the tools cannot do |

## Requirements

- Hermes Agent 0.20 or newer
- Node.js 20.18.1 or newer, with `npx` on your `PATH`
- A [LinkedCamp][lc] account on an active plan

## Install

```bash
hermes plugins install LinkedCamp/hermes-plugin --no-enable
hermes plugins enable linkedcamp
```

Start a new session. The first time the server starts, your browser opens the
[LinkedCamp][lc] authorization page. Paste your API key from
**Settings → Integrations** in the [LinkedCamp][lc] web app and approve. Hermes
keeps the token and refreshes it, so you sign in once.

If the tools do not appear after you sign in, run `/reload-mcp`.

### Use an API key instead of the browser sign-in

On a server or another headless machine, skip the plugin and add the server to
`~/.hermes/config.yaml` with your key:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  linkedcamp:
    url: "https://mcp.linkedcamp.com/mcp"
    headers:
      X-Api-Key: "${LINKEDCAMP_API_KEY}"
```

Put `LINKEDCAMP_API_KEY=...` in `~/.hermes/.env`. Do not paste the key into a
chat.

## What you can do

| Area | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Campaigns | Create drafts, set the audience, attach sending accounts, set limits and schedule, A/B variants, CSV import, launch |
| Sequences | Write multi-step LinkedIn and email sequences, apply templates, see version history and per-step stats |
| Leads | Search, inspect, add, move, export, notes, exclusions |
| Accounts | LinkedIn and email account limits, warm-up, health, SSI |
| Inbox | Unified inbox, threads, AI-drafted replies, saved replies |
| Analytics | Campaign and account performance, funnels, trends |
| Library | Tags, blacklists, templates, merge fields, blocked dates |
| AI agents | Reply agents, knowledge bases, training, test queries |
| Content | LinkedIn post drafting and publishing schedule |
| Agencies | List sub-accounts and read their campaigns, accounts and analytics |

The server has 133 tools. The tool list comes from the hosted server at run
time, so it can change without a new release of this plugin.

## Safety

Some of these tools reach real people. Launching a campaign starts sending
from your LinkedIn account and mailboxes, and `message_send` delivers a
message at once with no way to recall it.

- The server is marked `untrusted`. Hermes asks you before every tool that is
  not read-only, and refuses those tools in unattended runs such as cron jobs.
- The skill tells Hermes to show you the audience and full sequence before a
  launch, the exact text and recipient before a send, and to confirm each
  destructive call on its own.
- Plan limits are enforced by the server. A refusal is real and the skill does
  not look for a way around it.

The server never connects a LinkedIn account, rotates your API key or
configures CRM integrations. Do those in the [LinkedCamp][lc] web app.

## Disclosures

- **Network:** every tool call goes to `https://mcp.linkedcamp.com`, the
  hosted [LinkedCamp][lc] server, and acts on your account data there.
- **Third-party code:** the server is started with
  `npx -y mcp-remote@0.1.49`, which downloads the pinned
  [`mcp-remote`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote) package from npm and
  runs it as a local process for as long as the session is open. It bridges
  Hermes to the hosted server and handles the OAuth sign-in.
- **Stored credentials:** `mcp-remote` stores the OAuth tokens under
  `~/.mcp-auth/` on your machine. Delete that folder to sign out.
- **Browser:** the first sign-in opens your default browser and listens on a
  local port for the OAuth callback.
- **Telemetry:** the plugin collects none.

## Uninstall

```bash
hermes plugins disable linkedcamp
hermes plugins remove linkedcamp
```

To also sign out, delete the `~/.mcp-auth` folder.
